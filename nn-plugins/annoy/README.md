# drnb-nn-plugin-annoy

Nearest-neighbor plugin for `drnb` backed by the Annoy library. Runs out-of-process via `drnb-nn-plugin-run.py` and consumes the request/response format defined in `drnb_nn_plugin_sdk`.

Run locally:

```
uv run drnb-nn-plugin-run.py --method annoy --request /path/to/request.json
```

The request is generated by the `drnb` host; see `docs/nn-plugin-protocol.md` for field details.
